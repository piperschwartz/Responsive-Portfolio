        <p>I am originally from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, but I spent the last 4 year in Perth, Western Australia. I moved to Denver in February, and I am loving life here so far. My background is in Hospitality Management, but I have forever had a love for all things technology. I decided it was time to make a career change, and here I am. </p>
        
        <p>In my free time I am hanging out with friends, learning to code, being a self-proclaimed pun queen. I am looking forward to all the new things to come, and learning about what it takes to be a kick-ass Web Developer.</p>
        
        <p>Although this class is tough, and fast-paced, I believe I have what it takes to make it through and get all I can out of it. I find all the subjects very interesting, and I am exctied to see what the future holds. </p>
